# ðŸ“Š Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes telecom customer data to predict churn using *Machine Learning (Random Forest)*.  
It includes *EDA, model training, evaluation, and business recommendations*.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- Telecom_Churn_Analysis.ipynb â†’ Jupyter notebook with code
- Customer_Tele_Churn_Analysis.pdf â†’ Final PDF report
- Telco-Customer-Churn.csv â†’ Dataset (if shareable)
- images/ â†’ Visuals (confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance)

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
- Month-to-month contracts increase churn risk.
- Lack of tech support/online security is a major churn driver.
- Payment by electronic check strongly correlates with churn.
- New customers (<1 year tenure) are most at risk.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
- Algorithm: Random Forest
- Accuracy: ~79%
- Precision (Churn=1): ~63%
- Recall (Churn=1): ~47%
- ROC AUC: ~0.84

---

## ðŸ’¡ Business Recommendations
- Promote long-term contracts.
- Bundle tech support & security services.
- Encourage auto-pay methods instead of electronic checks.
- Focus retention programs on new customers.
- Offer loyalty discounts for high-paying customers.

---

## ðŸš€ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Random Forest Classifier
